\section*{Project Structure}
\subsection*{Frontend}
The frontend is built with React.js, providing an interactive UI for users to manage and view their class schedules. The frontend can be found in the \href{https://github.com/Bahar0900/Dynamic-Class-Routine-Management/tree/main/FrontEnd/class-routine-frontend}{Frontend Directory}.

\subsection*{Backend}
The backend is built with C#.NET and interacts with an SQL Server database to manage data efficiently. It can be found in the \href{https://github.com/Bahar0900/Dynamic-Class-Routine-Management/tree/main/Beckend/ClassRoutine}{Backend Directory}.
